## About Me
I’m Irish Balingit from Purok 2, Barangay Anunas, Angeles City. I have a small business, a side hustle in crochet. I make flowers and customize items using just yarn and a hook. My career goal is to become a licensed architect in the future and to become a successful businesswoman. But for now, I’m focusing on graduating, finding a job, and supporting both my needs and wants, as well as helping my parents. My passions and hobbies include crafting and drawing, and drawing is also my talent. I enjoy designing and have some skills in editing, though I’m still improving. One of my achievements is receiving honors in grades 9 and 12. My biggest achievement, however, is not disappointing my mother.
